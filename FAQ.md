##Frequently Asked Questions

### How big is the complete addon?

The Stargate Carter Addon Pack is around 2 GigaBytes.

### Is this addon on the Steam Workshop?

We brought the addon in its entirety to the workshop and put it into one collection for you to subscribe to: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180077636

Just follow the instructions placed in the description and you'll be ready to play with CAP!

### How do I download and how do I install this addon?

Detailed information about downloading and installation can be found in the INSTALLATION.MD file.

### Does this addon support older versions of Garry's Mod?

Our addon is only supported with the latest version of Garry's Mod currently being Version 13. We did not make it backwards compatible because that would be too much work and a lot of workarounds for previous builds.

If you still want to use Garry's Mod 10 for some reasons, then you can download rev 318 from the [old svn link here](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/carterspack/code/?p=318). We do NOT provide any support for this older version of Garry's Mod so we can NOT address any problems which may occur when playing with the old version of CAP and Garry's Mod.

### Does this addon support the developers versions of Garry's Mod?

CAP might not work a 100% correctly on the Developer's version of Garry's Mod as in the Developer's version various changes are being made and therefore errors and bugs may occur.

We can only fix the error (if any at all) experienced in the Developer's version AFTER the updates has been applied on the regular version of Garry's Mod.

Please do not post bug reports when you're opted into the Developers version of Garry's Mod.

### What do I do if something doesn't work? The troubleshooting steps:

1. Remove the .GMA files from CAP located in the addons folder so Steam/ Garry’s Mod can redownload them.
  
2. Uninstall/Disable all your addons and redownload/install ONLY CAP and Wire
  
3. Uninstall your whole Garry’s Mod Installation (Deleting the whole garry’s mod folder located under the COMMON folder) Then install only CAP and Wire.
  
4. If it still doesn't work then try downloading our addon via our Github Repository to make sure it’s not a problem with the steam workshop version.
  
5. If all of the above things don’t help resolve your problem, then please redirect yourself to the [Steam Support Forum](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/180077636).

### I received the following error message: "The addon version file is corrupt." What should I do?

Double check if you names the folders correctly as in **cap** and **cap_resources**

#### I received the following error message: "Your Steam profile is set to private, please change profile status to Public in your privacy settings in order to validate your copy of Garry's Mod. If your copy of Garry's Mod is illegal, your Steam ID will be reported." what should I do?

There are two things that could cause this error message being the following:

1. You recently updated your SVN but you did not change it to the new GitHub repository. This error message will only be shown for users that have the old SVN repository. If you receive this error simply update to the latest version on Github or use the Steam Workshop version.

2. You actually do have an illegal copy of Garry's Mod which means you be able to play with the Addon. We do not provide any assistance for users with a pirated copy nor do we have any intentions to remove these anti-piracy measures.

We added these anti-piracy measures for the simple reason of avoiding bug reports from users with a pirated copy where in many cases purchasing Garry's Mod would fix the problem.
